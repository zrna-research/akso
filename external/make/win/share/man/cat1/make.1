       The  _m_a_k_e  utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large
       program need to be recompiled, and  issue  the  commands  to  recompile
       them.   The  manual describes the GNU implementation of mmaakkee, which was
       written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently  main-
       tained  by  Paul  Smith.   Our examples show C programs, since they are
       very common, but you can use mmaakkee with any programming  language  whose
       compiler can be run with a shell command.  In fact, mmaakkee is not limited
       to programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some files must
       be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.

       To  prepare to use mmaakkee, you must write a file called the _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e that
       describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states
       the  commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the exe-
       cutable file is updated from object files, which are in  turn  made  by
       compiling source files.

       Once  a  suitable  makefile  exists,  each  time you change some source
       files, this simple shell command:

              mmaakkee

       suffices to perform all necessary  recompilations.   The  mmaakkee  program
       uses  the  makefile  description and the last-modification times of the
       files to decide which of the files need to be  updated.   For  each  of
       those files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.

       mmaakkee  executes  commands  in  the _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e to update one or more target
       _n_a_m_e_s, where _n_a_m_e is typically a program.  If no --ff option is  present,
       mmaakkee  will  look for the makefiles _G_N_U_m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, and _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e,
       in that order.

       Normally you should call your makefile  either  _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e  or  _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e.
       (We  recommend  _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e because it appears prominently near the begin-
       ning of a directory listing, right near other important files  such  as
       _R_E_A_D_M_E.)   The  first name checked, _G_N_U_m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, is not recommended for
       most makefiles.  You should use this name if you have a  makefile  that
       is  specific  to GNU mmaakkee, and will not be understood by other versions
       of mmaakkee.  If _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e is '-', the standard input is read.

       mmaakkee updates a target if it depends on  prerequisite  files  that  have
       been modified since the target was last modified, or if the target does
       not exist.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --bb, --mm
            These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of
            mmaakkee.

       --BB, ----aallwwaayyss--mmaakkee
            Unconditionally make all targets.

       --CC _d_i_r, ----ddiirreeccttoorryy=_d_i_r
            Change to directory _d_i_r before reading the makefiles or doing any-
            thing else.  If multiple --CC options are specified, each is  inter-
            preted  relative to the previous one: --CC / --CC etc is equivalent to
            --CC /etc.  This is typically used  with  recursive  invocations  of
            mmaakkee.

       --dd   Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.  The
            debugging information says which files are  being  considered  for
            remaking,  which  file-times  are being compared and with what re-
            sults, which files actually need  to  be  remade,  which  implicit
            rules  are considered and which are applied---everything interest-
            ing about how mmaakkee decides what to do.

       ----ddeebbuugg_[_=_F_L_A_G_S_]
            Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.   If
            the  _F_L_A_G_S are omitted, then the behavior is the same as if --dd was
            specified.  _F_L_A_G_S may be _a for all debugging output (same as using
            --dd),  _b for basic debugging, _v for more verbose basic debugging, _i
            for showing implicit rules, _j for details on  invocation  of  com-
            mands,  and  _m  for  debugging while remaking makefiles.  Use _n to
            disable all previous debugging flags.

       --ee, ----eennvviirroonnmmeenntt--oovveerrrriiddeess
            Give variables taken from the environment  precedence  over  vari-
            ables from makefiles.

       --EE _s_t_r_i_n_g, ----eevvaall _s_t_r_i_n_g
            Interpret _s_t_r_i_n_g using the eevvaall function, before parsing any make-
            files.

       --ff _f_i_l_e, ----ffiillee=_f_i_l_e, ----mmaakkeeffiillee=_F_I_L_E
            Use _f_i_l_e as a makefile.

       --ii, ----iiggnnoorree--eerrrroorrss
            Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.

       --II _d_i_r, ----iinncclluuddee--ddiirr=_d_i_r
            Specifies a directory _d_i_r to search for  included  makefiles.   If
            several  --II  options  are used to specify several directories, the
            directories are searched in the order specified.  Unlike the argu-
            ments  to other flags of mmaakkee, directories given with --II flags may
            come directly after the flag: --II_d_i_r is allowed, as well as --II _d_i_r.
            This syntax is allowed for compatibility with the C preprocessor's
            --II flag.

       --jj [_j_o_b_s], ----jjoobbss[=_j_o_b_s]
            Specifies the number of _j_o_b_s (commands) to run simultaneously.  If
            there  is  more than one --jj option, the last one is effective.  If
            the --jj option is given without an argument, mmaakkee  will  not  limit
            the number of jobs that can run simultaneously.

       --kk, ----kkeeeepp--ggooiinngg
            Continue  as  much  as  possible after an error.  While the target
            that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot  be  remade,  the
            other dependencies of these targets can be processed all the same.

       --ll [_l_o_a_d], ----llooaadd--aavveerraaggee[=_l_o_a_d]
            Specifies  that  no new jobs (commands) should be started if there
            are others jobs running and the load average is at least  _l_o_a_d  (a
            floating-point number).  With no argument, removes a previous load
            limit.

       --LL, ----cchheecckk--ssyymmlliinnkk--ttiimmeess
            Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.

       --nn, ----jjuusstt--pprriinntt, ----ddrryy--rruunn, ----rreeccoonn
            Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them
            (except in certain circumstances).

       --oo _f_i_l_e, ----oolldd--ffiillee=_f_i_l_e, ----aassssuummee--oolldd=_f_i_l_e
            Do not remake the file _f_i_l_e even if it is older than its dependen-
            cies, and do not remake anything on account of  changes  in  _f_i_l_e.
            Essentially  the file is treated as very old and its rules are ig-
            nored.

       --OO[_t_y_p_e], ----oouuttppuutt--ssyynncc[=_t_y_p_e]
            When running multiple jobs in parallel with --jj, ensure the  output
            of  each  job  is collected together rather than interspersed with
            output from other jobs.  If _t_y_p_e is not specified or is ttaarrggeett the
            output from the entire recipe for each target is grouped together.
            If _t_y_p_e is lliinnee the output from each command line within a  recipe
            is grouped together.  If _t_y_p_e is rreeccuurrssee output from an entire re-
            cursive make is grouped together.  If _t_y_p_e is nnoonnee output synchro-
            nization is disabled.

       --pp, ----pprriinntt--ddaattaa--bbaassee
            Print  the data base (rules and variable values) that results from
            reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise spec-
            ified.   This  also prints the version information given by the --vv
            switch (see below).  To print the data base without trying to  re-
            make any files, use _m_a_k_e _-_p _-_f_/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.

       --qq, ----qquueessttiioonn
            ``Question  mode''.   Do  not run any commands, or print anything;
            just return an exit status that is zero if the  specified  targets
            are already up to date, nonzero otherwise.

       --rr, ----nnoo--bbuuiillttiinn--rruulleess
            Eliminate  use of the built-in implicit rules.  Also clear out the
            default list of suffixes for suffix rules.

       --RR, ----nnoo--bbuuiillttiinn--vvaarriiaabblleess
            Don't define any built-in variables.

       --ss, ----ssiilleenntt, ----qquuiieett
            Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.

       ----nnoo--ssiilleenntt
            Cancel the effect of the --ss option.

       --SS, ----nnoo--kkeeeepp--ggooiinngg, ----ssttoopp
            Cancel the effect of the --kk option.

       --tt, ----ttoouucchh
            Touch files (mark them up to date without  really  changing  them)
            instead  of  running their commands.  This is used to pretend that
            the commands were done, in order to  fool  future  invocations  of
            mmaakkee.

       ----ttrraaccee
            Information  about  the disposition of each target is printed (why
            the target is being rebuilt and what commands are run  to  rebuild
            it).

       --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
            Print  the version of the mmaakkee program plus a copyright, a list of
            authors and a notice that there is no warranty.

       --ww, ----pprriinntt--ddiirreeccttoorryy
            Print a message containing the working directory before and  after
            other  processing.   This  may  be useful for tracking down errors
            from complicated nests of recursive mmaakkee commands.

       ----nnoo--pprriinntt--ddiirreeccttoorryy
            Turn off --ww, even if it was turned on implicitly.

       --WW _f_i_l_e, ----wwhhaatt--iiff=_f_i_l_e, ----nneeww--ffiillee=_f_i_l_e, ----aassssuummee--nneeww=_f_i_l_e
            Pretend that the target _f_i_l_e has just been  modified.   When  used
            with  the --nn flag, this shows you what would happen if you were to
            modify that file.  Without --nn, it is almost the same as running  a
            _t_o_u_c_h  command  on the given file before running mmaakkee, except that
            the modification time is changed only in the imagination of mmaakkee.

       ----wwaarrnn--uunnddeeffiinneedd--vvaarriiaabblleess
            Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
       GNU mmaakkee exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully
       parsed  and no targets that were built failed.  A status of one will be
       returned if the --qq flag was used and  mmaakkee  determines  that  a  target
       needs  to  be  rebuilt.  A status of two will be returned if any errors
       were encountered.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       The full documentation for mmaakkee is maintained as a Texinfo manual.   If
       the  iinnffoo  and  mmaakkee  programs are properly installed at your site, the
